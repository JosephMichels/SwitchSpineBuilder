# SwitchSpineBuilder
Application to combine many Nintendo Switch spine images into one PDF for easy printing.

* Put all of your spines in the 'Spines' directory and then run the application.
* Select the spines you want to add.
* Click the 'Generate Images + PDF' button.

It will generate a series of images that has combined all of the spines, as well as a single PDF with all of them included.

The PDF is setup to be easy to print as a Letter size (8.5" x 11") document and the sizing should be correct when printed as long as you specify no scaling.

The application expects the spines to be a resolution of 122x1906 and if there are some selected that are not, they will be resized to that when exporting.
